<div class = "main_description" > <p>From the inception of an idea to the commercialization of a widget, NI's unique platform-based approach to engineering and science applications has driven progress across a wide variety of industries. Central to this approach is LabVIEW, a development environment designed specifically to accelerate the productivity of engineers and scientists. With a graphical programming syntax that makes it simple to visualize, create, and code engineering systems, LabVIEW is unmatched in helping you reduce test times, deliver business insights based on collected data, and translate ideas into reality. LabVIEW is designed to interoperate with other software, whether alternative development approaches or open-source platforms, to ensure you can use all of the tools available to you. With an included software service program that provides phone and email support from degreed engineers, updates to the latest versions, and 24/7 access to online training, a purchase of LabVIEW includes everything you need for success.</p> </div>
